Object Detectiom API
# TensorFlow Object Detection Setup in Google Colab

This project demonstrates how to set up TensorFlow's Object Detection API in a Google Colab environment, including mounting Google Drive for persistent storage, cloning TensorFlow models, and preparing datasets for object detection tasks.

## Prerequisite

- A Google Drive account with sufficient storage space.
- Google Colab environment for executing the code.
- The TensorFlow and Keras libraries (the script confirms the version 2.13.0 and 2.13.1 respectively)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Mount Google Drive**: 
   Use the provided code to mount your Google Drive in the Colab environment for accessing and storing files.
   
2. **Clone TensorFlow Models**: 
   The script clones the TensorFlow models repository into the Colab VM for access to the Object Detection API.

3. **Compile Protobufs and Install Object Detection API**: 
   Necessary commands are included to compile Protobufs and install the TensorFlow Object Detection API within the environment.

4. **Organize Dataset**:
   Unzip the datasets into designated folders and organize them into training and testing splits.

## Execution Steps

1. Run the provided code in a Google Colab notebook. Ensure you follow the steps in sequence to correctly set up the environment.

2. Verify the TensorFlow and Keras versions using the `print` statements.

3. Test the model builder to ensure that the Object Detection API is correctly installed.

4. Execute the commands to organize the dataset into `test_labels` and `train_labels` directories for model training and evaluation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors like "File exists" or "No such file or directory", ensure that:
- The directories you are trying to create do not already exist.
- The paths provided to the commands are correct and the files exist at those paths.

## Note

This README assumes that the user has prior knowledge of working with Google Colab and TensorFlow Object Detection API. For detailed instructions, refer to the official TensorFlow documentation and Google Colab tutorials.
